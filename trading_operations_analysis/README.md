# Trading Operations Analysis
FinTrack Solutions is an innovative company that provides advanced tools for monitoring and analyzing financial performance. 
This project aims to improve and optimize an existing spreadsheet that tracks the financial transactions carried out by our main client, Bob, since January 1, 2021. 
The project will offer a comprehensive analysis of trading operations and enable strategic decisions to be made based on reliable and accurately structured data.

## Project objective
The objective is to transform a simple spreadsheet into a dynamic and visually effective analysis tool. 
This will provide relevant insights into the revenue generated from trading stocks in different financial markets and facilitate informed decisions.

## Added value for FinTrack Solutions:
Improved management and analysis of trading operations.
Implementation of interactive visualization tools that improve data comprehension.
Automation of financial analysis functions, reducing the time and resources required for manual analysis.

## Dataset
The [dataset](https://proai-datasets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/tradesonexchanges.xlsx) represents the financial transactions recorded in Bob's stock trading. 
The columns in the spreadsheet are:
- **TradeID**: unique trade identifier (8 digits).
- **Stock Exchange**: market where the transaction was executed.
- **Region**: geographical area of the market.
- **Date Added**: date of purchase of the stock (YYYY-MM-DD format).
- **Quantity**: number of shares bought/sold.
- **Buy Price**: purchase price per share.
- **Date Sold**: date of sale of the stock (YYYY-MM-DD format).
- **Sell Price**: sale price per share.

## Required Tasks
Spreadsheet Modification

The spreadsheet will be reorganized for improved readability and operational utility. Four main tabs will be created, each with a specific style and structure.

### Tab 1: “My Trades”
This tab presents a summary of trading operations carried out.

Style: 
- Header: Comic Sans MS font (12pt, blue) with double border.
- All non-header cells will be framed with a thin black border.
- The “Date Added” and “Date Sold” columns will be formatted as DD/MM/YY.

Added value: Allows you to clearly view all transactions carried out with consistent and customized formatting, facilitating quick analysis of operations.

### Tab 2: “Stock Exchanges”
In this tab, you will create a pivot table that groups financial markets by region and reports the number of shares traded.

Style: 
- Header: Comic Sans MS (12pt, blue) with double border.
- Each cell outlined in black.

Content: 
- Pivot table to display the number of shares traded per state.
- Additional column indicating whether taxes are payable based on a threshold value of 67 shares traded.

Added value: Automates tax calculation and provides a clear picture of the transactions carried out for each market.


### Tab 3: “Profit Insights”
This tab is dedicated to analyzing the profit obtained from trading operations.

Style: 
- Heading: Comic Sans MS (12pt, blue) with double border.

Content: 
- Column A: reference to the TradeIDs in the “My Trades” tab.
- Column B: duration of share ownership (calculated in days).
- Column C: profit generated by each trade (difference between sale and purchase price multiplied by the number of shares traded). Currency format: US dollar with 5 decimal places.
- Histogram to display the distribution of trade duration.
- Comment below the graph to explain whether the duration follows a normal distribution or not.

Added Value: Provides an immediate and detailed analysis of profits, highlighting the performance of trades in relation to their duration.


### Tab 4: “Number of Trades Exchanged”
This tab presents a contingency table to analyze the distribution of the number of trades by region.

Style: 
- Heading: Comic Sans MS (12pt, blue).

Content: 
- Contingency table showing the frequency of trades by region.
- Calculation of probabilities associated with specific events listed below

The events to be considered for the calculation of probabilities are:
- Probability of a trade occurring in the United Kingdom with a quantity equal to 1
- Probability of a trade occurring in an Asian country with a quantity <= 8
  
Added Value: Provides a probabilistic analysis of transactions, helping to make strategic decisions based on trading distributions by region.


## Conclusion
This project is not limited to a simple spreadsheet modification, but transforms financial data into a powerful decision-making tool for FinTrack Solutions. Thanks to an easy-to-read structure and advanced features such as pivot tables, profit analysis, and probability distributions, the client will be able to monitor its financial performance and optimize its trading operations in an effective and strategic manner.
