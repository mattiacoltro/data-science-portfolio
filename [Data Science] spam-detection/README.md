# Email Analysis and Classification for SPAM Detection

## Technologies & Tools
- Python
- NLP: Topic Modeling, Name Entity Recognition
- Machine Learning: classifier

## Project Description
A company specialized in Artificial Intelligence–based automation, aims to develop a software library for analyzing and classifying incoming emails.  
The main objective is to identify **SPAM emails** in order to perform in-depth content analysis and improve the security of corporate communications.

The project originates from the CEO’s need to better understand **trends, content, and behaviors** associated with SPAM emails. These insights will be used to:
- enhance anti-spam filters;
- strengthen communication security;
- support strategic decisions in the cybersecurity domain.

## Project Objectives
Based on an email dataset provided by the CTO, the project aims to:

- Train a **classifier** to identify SPAM emails.
- Identify the **main topics** among emails classified as SPAM.
- Compute the **semantic distance between topics** to evaluate the heterogeneity of SPAM content.
- Extract information about **organizations mentioned** in **NON-SPAM** emails.

## Added Value
Email analysis provides ProfessionAI with several strategic advantages:

### Improved Anti-Spam Filtering
An efficient classifier significantly reduces the number of unwanted emails reaching inboxes, optimizing the management of corporate communications.

### In-Depth Content Analysis
Identifying the main topics within SPAM emails makes it possible to uncover trends, recurring themes, and patterns, strengthening cybersecurity strategies.

### Heterogeneity Assessment
Measuring semantic distance between topics helps assess the diversity of SPAM content, enabling better defenses against a wide range of attack types.

### Organization Identification
Extracting organizations from legitimate emails can be leveraged to enhance **business intelligence** processes and improve communication management with clients and partners.

## Conclusion
This project provides ProfessionAI with a comprehensive analysis of incoming emails, with a strong focus on SPAM detection and semantic content analysis.

Through **topic modeling**, **semantic distance evaluation**, and **key information extraction** from legitimate emails, the company will be able to:
- significantly improve anti-spam filters;
- gain strategic insights into the most relevant content;
- optimize corporate communication management.

The solution ultimately increases communication security and delivers a competitive advantage in the market.
