# Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis Using Tweets

## Project Overview

MarketPulse Analytics, a leading company in market research and digital insights, has launched a project aimed at estimating public sentiment toward Bitcoin by analyzing millions of tweets.
As a Data Scientist, your role is to perform sentiment analysis on the collected data and understand how opinions about Bitcoin evolve over time.
In addition, you will investigate user engagement metrics and explore potential correlations between sentiment trends and Bitcoin price fluctuations.

## Objectives

### 1. Sentiment Classification

The first phase involves analyzing the sentiment of tweets using a sentiment analysis model.
Each tweet will be classified as:

* **Positive**
* **Negative**
* **Neutral**

based on keywords, tone, and linguistic patterns.
This classification will allow you to measure public sentiment toward Bitcoin on a daily basis.

---

### 2. Temporal Sentiment Trends

After classifying sentiments, you will produce a time-series visualization showing day-by-day variation in:

* **Positive tweets**
* **Negative tweets**
* **Neutral tweets**

This graph will highlight peaks, declines, and shifts in public opinion regarding Bitcoin.

### 3. User Engagement Analysis

To better understand social-media interactions, you will answer two key questions:

1. **Do negative tweets receive more likes than positive tweets?**
   You will compute and compare the average number of likes for negative and positive tweets.

2. **Do negative tweets receive more replies than positive tweets?**
   A similar analysis will be conducted by comparing the average number of replies.

This part of the study will reveal whether negative sentiment attracts more attention or generates more discussion online.

### 4. Correlation With Bitcoin Price

To add depth to the analysis, you will examine the relationship between sentiment variation and Bitcoin’s market value.

You will:

* Acquire historical Bitcoin price data (BTC/USD)
* Compare daily sentiment trends with corresponding price changes
* Identify potential correlations

This approach aims to answer a key question:
**Does public sentiment influence Bitcoin’s price, or does price movement influence sentiment on social media?**
