## Project Description
The newly founded **IASS (International Alliance for Safe Skies)** has commissioned an in-depth analysis of all recorded **airplane accidents from 1919 to 2023**.  

A dataset containing nearly **25,000 incidents** has been provided, including the following information:  

- **date**: date of the accident  
- **type**: type of aircraft  
- **registration**: aircraft registration code  
- **operator**: aircraft operator  
- **fatalities**: number of deaths  
- **location**: place of the accident  
- **country**: country where the accident occurred  
- **cat**: accident category as described by ASN  

The goal is to uncover **useful insights** through data analysis, supported by **charts and visualizations**.

## Example Insights
These are some example questions that can be answered through the dataset (but do not limit yourself to these — perform a deeper analysis and generate additional insights):  

- Which country has recorded the highest number of accidents?  
- Do accidents occur more frequently on specific days of the week?  
- Which operators are the safest?  
- Which aircraft type has caused the highest number of fatalities?  
- How did accident trends change after September 11, 2001?

## Bonus Task
- Create a **cartogram** to represent the number of accidents by country.
