## Project Description
Superstore, one of the most innovative companies in the European market, has decided to transform its decision-making process by adopting a **data-driven approach**.  
To maintain its leadership, the company aims to build a system for **continuous monitoring of its European operations** and implement a **targeted marketing strategy** focused on products with the highest growth potential.  

The task assigned to the Data Analyst is to create an **interactive and dynamic solution** to monitor business performance and guide strategic choices, replacing outdated analysis methods such as spreadsheets and static presentations.

## Request 1: Tableau Dashboard for Activity Monitoring
The first goal is to develop an **interactive Tableau Dashboard** that allows monitoring of the following key metrics:  

- **Sales performance over time**: a dynamic visualization to highlight sales trends and seasonality.  
- **Profit by Country**: an analysis of profit distribution across European countries where Superstore operates, showing areas with higher margins.  
- **Shipped Products by Shipping Class**: a visualization of the number of products shipped per shipping category (e.g., standard, express, etc.).  

**Dashboard Features**:  
- **Dynamic filters**: filter by country, time period, shipping class, and product to obtain granular insights.  
- **Dynamic charts**: real-time monitoring of sales, profits, and shipping efficiency.  
- **Added value**: potential inclusion of additional insights, such as top-selling product categories, comparison of profits vs. sales volumes, and monitoring of logistic costs by shipping class.

## Request 2: Tableau Story for Marketing Budget Allocation
Superstore has a significant marketing budget to promote high-potential products. The business requires an analysis to support **budget allocation decisions**.  

The **Tableau Story** will clearly present:  
- **Products to allocate more budget to**: products with high profit margins but insufficient sales.  
- **Products to allocate less budget to**: products with low margins or saturated sales.  
- **Products to eliminate**: products that generate costs without significant returns, suggesting their removal from the catalog.  

**Analytical Approach**:  
- Sales performance analysis per product, comparing sales vs. profit margins.  
- Identification of undervalued products with high growth potential.  
- Use of the **3C rule (Context, Conflict, Conclusion)** to structure the presentation:  
  - **Context**: overview of current performance.  
  - **Conflict**: challenges with underperforming products.  
  - **Conclusion**: recommendations on where to allocate the budget to maximize profit.  

**Added value**: provide additional insights on external factors that may affect marketing strategy, such as seasonality or consumer preferences in different European markets.

## Bonus: Additional Insights
Superstore is open to further insights for improving performance. By exploring the data further, you could:  

- **Profit by City**: identify the most profitable European cities for future expansion campaigns.  
- **Shipping by Product**: detect logistic inefficiencies (e.g., high shipping costs for certain products) and suggest alternatives to optimize margins.  
- **Country Performance**: compare growth and profit trends across European countries to determine markets worth expanding or downsizing.  

---

## Conclusion
With a set of **dynamic dashboards** and a **well-structured Tableau Story**, Superstore will be able to monitor its European operations and make more effective marketing decisions.  
This solution will allow the company to **improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase profits**, ensuring continued success in a highly competitive market.
