# Prediction of creditworthiness
You have been hired by Pro National Bank as a data scientist, and your first task is to create a model that can estimate the creditworthiness of customers, in order to help the dedicated team understand whether or not to accept credit card applications.

## Data description

You are given anonymized data from customers who have already obtained credit cards and are regularly pay their installments. The data are available in a CSV ﬁle [credit_scoring.csv](https://proai-datasets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/credit_scoring.csv) that contains the information of account holders who have applied for a line of credit.

## Goal

You have to make a model that predicts the given target, which is the TARGET variable that indicates whether the
customer has a good creditworthiness.
If a customer is denied a credit card, the team must be able to provide a reason for it. This means that the model must provide easily interpretable directions.
