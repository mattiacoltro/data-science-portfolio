# Wikipedia Content Analysis & Classification Project

## Objectives

### 1. Descriptive Content Analysis

The first objective is to conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of Wikipedia articles across different thematic categories such as Culture, Economics, Medicine, Technology, Politics, Science, and more.

The EDA includes:

* Counting the number of articles per category
* Calculating the average word count per article
* Identifying the longest and shortest articles per category
* Creating word clouds for each category to visualize the most frequent and relevant terms

### 2. Development of an Automatic Classifier

The second objective is to build a machine learning model capable of automatically classifying articles according to their category.

The classification system is trained on two textual fields:

* **Summary**: a short introductory paragraph
* **Documents**: the full article text

### 3. Extraction of New Insights

The project also aims to identify valuable insights, such as:

* Article density per category
* Linguistic trends across topics
* Possible gaps or underrepresented areas

These insights can help Wikimedia optimize content organization and editorial strategies.
